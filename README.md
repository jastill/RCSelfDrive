# RCSelfDrive
RC Car Self Drive Project

Constantly losing to my kids at Mini-z racing, I need to look to into tech to help.

Start simple and then look to incorporate, indoor nav, vision, lidar or any tech that can help me improve.....

## Simple start

After buying a GL Racing chassis, the immediate challenge is it's size. So let's start with something a little larger, an old and non functional Losi Mini-T.


## Marvelmind

Even simpler start for the self driving. Rather than cameras/lidar/sensors, reuse a [Marvelmind](https://marvelmind.com) indoor nav system that offers 2c accuracy.
